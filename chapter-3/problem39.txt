Problem 3.39 from page 262

Equation 3.1 says that if T is a data type with size L, and
the two-dimensional array D is initialized as

    T D[R][C]

and x_D points to the beginning of D, then

    &D[i][j] = x_D + L(C*i + j)

In the problem, we have

    int A[N][N], B[N][N]

with N = 16, so

    &A[i][0] = x_A + 4(16i + 0) = x_A + 64i
    &B[0][k] = x_B + 4(16*0 + k) = x_b + 4k
    &B[N][k] = x_B + 4(16*16 + k) = x_B + 4k + 1024
