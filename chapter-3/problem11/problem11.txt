Problem 3.11 from page 197

"It is common to find assembly code lines of the form

xorq %rdx,%rdx

in code that was generated from C where no EXCLUSIVE-OR operations
were present."

A. This operation replaces the contents of %rdx with 0.

B. A more straightforward way to implement the same effect is

    movq $0,%rdx
