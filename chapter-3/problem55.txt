Problem 3.55 from page 305

.LC3:
    .long   0
    .long   1077936128

1077936128 = 0x40400000

so we are looking at the double with bit representation

0x4040000000000000.

The sign bit is the first bit, which is 0.

The exponent field is the bits 2 through 12 of 0x4040, that is

    10000000100

so the exponent is 1024 + 4 - 1023 = 5.

The fraction field is all zeros, so the significand is 1.0.

Thus, the number encoded is (-1)^0 * 1.0 * 2^5 = 32.
